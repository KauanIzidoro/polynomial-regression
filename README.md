## Application of __Polynomial Regression__ to stress-strain curve interpolation to determine the tenacity modulus

---

This paper presents an analytical solution for calculating the modulus of toughness from the stress-strain curve of materials. This curve is obtained through tests performed with specific testing machines for analyzing the deformation of materials. The modulus of toughness is determined by calculating the area under the stress-strain curve. The analytical method used to fit the curve was polynomial regression, highlighting the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data processing.
